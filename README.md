Wk 4 Homework

I started by looking a videos and websites with tutorials about how to make this.

Then studied more JavaScript to write the questions needed for the quiz

And then more time drafting the questions and then writing them in JS as objects.

Then more JS study, reviewing Dave's classes and then my Sunday is gone.
